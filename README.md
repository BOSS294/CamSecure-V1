## Features

* **Multi-mode Video Streams**:

  * Live Feed with motion detection overlay
  * Room Scan with entry/exit zone monitoring
  * Thermal Vision with anomaly detection
  * Intruder Heatmap with emotion, human, fire/smoke, and anomaly detection
* **Face Recognition**: Register a known face and skip false alarms
* **Automated Logging**: Timestamped logs of events and alerts
* **Audio Feedback & Voice Control**: Text-to-speech prompts and speech recognition commands
* **Network Meter & Device Radar**: Real-time network health and simulated radar display
* **Background Mode**: Hide GUI and continue monitoring
* **PyQt5 GUI**: Dark-themed interface with real-time grid display, controls, and log console

---

## Architecture & Modules

* **app.py / main.py**: Entry point; initializes PyQt5 `MainWindow` and starts the application loop.
* **Detector**: Core class handling camera capture, frame processing, motion detection, face recognition, thermal and advanced threat analysis.
* **CameraWorker (QThread)**: Continuously fetches and processes frames across modes in a separate thread.
* **MainWindow**: PyQt5 GUI, sets up layouts, buttons, panels, video frames, log console, and integrates `Detector` and `CameraWorker`.
* **NetworkMeter & DeviceRadar**: Custom QWidget classes for network speed gauge and device sweep radar.

---

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* OpenCV `cv2`
* DeepFace
* PyQt5
* pyttsx3
* SpeechRecognition
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Requests

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python deepface pyqt5 pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition numpy scipy requests
```

Additionally, ensure you have:

* A working microphone for voice control
* A webcam for video capture

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   ```

git clone [https://github.com/BOSS294/CamSecure-V1.git](https://github.com/BOSS294/CamSecure-V1.git)
cd CamSecure-V1

````

2. Install the prerequisites as shown above.

3. Create necessary directories (if not auto-generated):

```bash
mkdir recordings logs screenshots known_faces recordings/live_feed recordings/room_scan recordings/thermal recordings/paranormal
mkdir recordings/advanced_feed threats
````

---

## Configuration

* **VIDEO\_OUTPUT\_DIR**: Base directory for recording videos. Default: `recordings`
* **LOG\_DIR**: Directory for session logs. Default: `logs`
* **SCREENSHOT\_DIR**: Directory for saved screenshots. Default: `screenshots`
* **KNOWN\_FACES\_DIR**: Directory to store registered face images.
* **DeepFace Threshold**: Cosine similarity threshold (0.7) for face matching.
* **Frame Modes**: Mode indices 0-3 correspond to live, room, thermal, and advanced respectively.

Edit constants at the top of `main.py` to modify paths or thresholds.

---

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

* Click **â–¶ Start Detection** to begin processing frames.
* **â–  Stop Detection** stops recording and merges videos.
* **ðŸ§‘ Register My Face** captures and registers your face so it isn't flagged as unknown.
* **ðŸ•¶ Background Mode** hides the GUI; say "open panel" to restore.
* **ðŸŽ™ Audio Command** toggles voice control for commands.
* Use the mode buttons (Live Feed, Room Scan, Thermal Vision, Intruder Heatmap) to switch view.

## Code Documentation

### Detector Class

* **`__init__`**: Initializes video capture, output writers, and loads registered face embedding.
* **`process_frame(mode)`**: Processes a single frame based on the selected mode:

  * **Mode 0**: Motion detection with bounding boxes and logging
  * **Mode 1**: Room scan with entry/exit zones, face/body detection, and screenshots
  * **Mode 2**: Thermal vision using color maps and anomaly detection
  * **Mode 3**: Advanced detection (emotion, human, fire/smoke, anomaly) with zoom and threat logging
* **`is_registered_face(face_img)`**: Compares detected face to registered face embedding.
* **`register_my_face()`**: Captures and saves a face image to `known_faces`.
* **`release()`**: Cleans up capture and writers; speaks session end and log merge.

### CameraWorker (QThread)

* Runs `Detector.process_frame` in a loop for each mode and emits frames.

### MainWindow Class

* Sets up PyQt5 dark-themed GUI, video labels, control buttons, and log console.
* Connects button events to start/stop detection, register face, toggle modes, and voice commands.
* **`update_frame`**: Receives frames from `CameraWorker` and displays them.
* **`show_motion_analysis`**: Updates motion summary label and log.

---

## Voice Commands

* **"Analyse the room"**: Switch to Room Scan mode
* **"Tell me about network"**: Reports network status
* **"Last detection"**: Reads last detection summary
* **"Open panel"**: Restores GUI in background mode
* **"Export report"**: Copies log report to `recordings/report.txt`
* **"Register my face"**: Captures and registers face
